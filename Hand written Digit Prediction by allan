Handwritten Digit Prediction Project

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits. Specifically, we want to recognize which digit (0 to 9) is represented in a given image.


Data Source:
We’ll use the MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark for digit recognition. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size.

Import Library and Import Data:
First, let’s import the necessary Python libraries:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

mnist = load_digits()
X, y = mnist.data, mnist.target



Describe Data:
Explore the dataset:
Number of samples: 70,000
Number of features (pixel values): 64 (28x28)
Number of classes (digits): 10 (0 to 9)


Data Visualization:
Visualize a few sample images to understand the data:
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
for i in range(10):
    plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(X[i].reshape(8, 8), cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Label: {y[i]}")
    plt.axis('off')
plt.show()


Data Preprocessing:
Scale pixel values to [0, 1]:
X_scaled = X / 16.0
Split data into training and testing sets:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Modeling:
Choose a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network) and train it on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data.

Prediction:
Make predictions on new handwritten digit samples using the trained model.

Explanation
Finally, interpret the results. How well did the model perform? Were there any specific challenges (e.g., confusing similar digits)?
