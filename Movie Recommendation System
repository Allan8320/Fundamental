                                       Movie Recommendation System Project
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests personalized movie choices to users based on their preferences and historical interactions.

Data Source:
We’ll need a dataset containing information about movies, user ratings, and possibly additional features (such as genres, release years, etc.). You can explore publicly available movie datasets or create your own.

Import Library and Import Data"
First, import the necessary Python libraries:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Next, load your movie dataset (replace your_movies.csv with the actual file name):
# Load your movie dataset
movies_df = pd.read_csv("your_movies.csv")
ratings_df = pd.read_csv("your_ratings.csv")  # User ratings


Describe Data:
Explore the dataset:
Check the number of movies and users.
Look at a few rows to understand the format of the data.


Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to gain insights:
Histograms of movie ratings distribution.
Heatmaps showing user-item interactions (which movies were rated by which users).


Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (if any).
Create a user-item matrix (rows represent users, columns represent movies, and the values are ratings).
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
In this case, our target variable (y) is the movie recommendation score (predicted rating).
Features (X) can include movie attributes (genres, release year, etc.) and user-specific features (demographics, viewing history, etc.).


Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training and testing subsets:
X = movies_df[["genre", "release_year"]]  # Example features
y = ratings_df["rating"]  # Target variable

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


Modeling:
Choose a recommendation algorithm:
Collaborative Filtering (user-based or item-based)
Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition or Alternating Least Squares)
Content-Based Filtering (using movie features)
Train your chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing data.

Prediction:
Make personalized movie recommendations for users based on their preferences and the trained model.

Explanation:
Finally, interpret the results. How well does the recommendation system perform? Are there specific genres or user segments where it excels?
