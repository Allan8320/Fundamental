                              Mileage Prediction Project

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the mileage (fuel efficiency) of vehicles based on relevant features.

Data Source:
We’ll need a dataset containing information about various vehicles, including features like engine size, weight, and horsepower. You can explore publicly available automotive datasets or collect your own data.

Import Library and Import Data:
First, import the necessary Python libraries:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Next, load your dataset (replace your_dataset.csv with the actual file name):
# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

Describe Data:
Explore the dataset:
Check the number of samples and features.
Look at a few rows to understand the format of the data.

Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to gain insights:
Scatter plots for features like engine size vs. mileage.
Histograms to understand the distribution of mileage values.


Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (if any).
Identify relevant features (X) and the target variable (y):
X: Features such as engine size, weight, horsepower, etc.
y: Mileage (fuel efficiency).


Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training and testing subsets:

X = data.drop(columns=["Mileage"])  # Features
y = data["Mileage"]  # Target variable

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Modeling:
Choose a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) and train it on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) on the testing data.

Prediction:
Make predictions on new vehicle data using the trained model.

Explanation:
Finally, interpret the results. How well does the model predict mileage? Are there specific features that strongly influence fuel efficiency?
